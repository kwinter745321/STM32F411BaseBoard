# README.md - Video16 - fifth in series on Serial Transfers

November 22, 2024

I obtained a zip file of the pySerialTransfer program 

[Link](https://pypi.org/project/pySerialTransfer/)

I unzipped it, and inside is a folder called pySerialTransfer.
this folder is what you see here in this GitHub site.

I modified the pySerialTransfer program slightly by adding the serial-loopback and adding print statements.

Also I copied one of the test_programs (tx_data.py) into this folder and modified it slightly.
